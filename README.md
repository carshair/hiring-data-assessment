## Description

### Background

carSHAiR is a peer to peer car sharing platform with a mission to bring high tech solutions to provide an exceptional experience for Guests and Hosts within the car sharing space.

Adjacent to the car sharing industry is the bike sharing industry. Individuals in densely populated urban centers often need to travel distances that are too short to require a car/taxi, but far enough such that walking is an inconvenient option. Bike sharing offers a solution to fill this market space.

Sourced from an open-sourced database (see Resources section of this readme), provided in this repository is a collection of bike sharing data from Jan 2019 - Feb 2022 for the city of Toronto, ON.

### Objectives

As a Data Engineer, a typical assignment could be - given a raw data set, find patterns in the data that could help the Marketing department make more informed decisions when planning their upcoming campaigns.

Given the data, the Marketing department specifically needs to understand:

1. The average trip time
2. The effect of annual membership on average trip time
3. Which stations receive the most traffic
4. Optimal number of bikes to place in each station

Aside from the explicitly stated requirements listed above, identify (execution not required) some other potential insights this data set might be able to provide answers to.

### Constraints

- Answers to the assessment objectives must be presented in a format appropriate for a non-technical audience
- Implementation must be written in python

### Resources
